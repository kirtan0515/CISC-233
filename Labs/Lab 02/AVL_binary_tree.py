# Q- 2. (2.5 pts)
# In this question you will develop a Binary Search Tree class, you don’t have to worry about
# insertion, deletion, search, etc., the constructor of the BST class you accept a list and build the tree,
# in your class you need to have a method called AVL to check if the tree is balanced. An AVL tree is a binary search
# tree that is height balanced: for each node x , the heights of the left and right subtree of x differ by at most 1,
# you need to be clear about the balance factor of the node.
#
#                       Balance Factor = |hl − hr | = {−1, 0, 1} to check

# the correctness of your implementation use the following two lists:
# a. [20, 15, 10, 5, 8, 2] unbalanced
# b. [10, 5, 15, 2, 8, 20] balanced
